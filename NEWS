* A total of 328 samples added since Bioconductor 3.6 (October, 2017) release
* Datasets added since Bioconductor 3.6 (October, 2017) release
    - LiJ_2017 (196 samples)
    - LouisS_2016 (92 samples)
    - SmitsSA_2017 (40 samples)
* A curator field has been added to metadata to credit the work of curators
* curatedMetagenomicData is currently on a diet and being refactored:
    - The docs directory used to build the github pages site has been moved to a
      branch, making the R package smaller
    - All code used for processing of raw data in R is moving to a seperate
      GitHub repository curatedMetagenomicDataPipeline
    - Curation takes place in the curatedMetagenomicDataCuration repository and
      curation is automatically checked; contributions are welcomed
    - All code used for processing of raw data beyond R is moving to a seperate
      GitHub repository curatedMetagenomicDataHighLoad
* All data has been reprocessed to ensure updated and correct curation
