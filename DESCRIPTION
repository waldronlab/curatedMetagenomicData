Package: curatedMetagenomicData
Title: Curated Metagenomic Data of the Human Microbiome
Description:
    curatedMetagenomicData provides standardized, curated human microbiome data
    for novel analyses. The package includes gene families, marker abundance,
    marker presence, pathway abundance, pathway coverage, and relative abundance
    for samples collected from different body sites. The bacterial, fungal,
    archaeal, and taxonomic abundance of each sample's raw data were calculated
    with MetaPhlAn3 and the metabolic functional potential was calculated with
    HUMAnN3. The curated metadata and profiled raw data are available as
    (Tree)SummarizedExperiment objects.
